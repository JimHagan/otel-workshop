# Lab 5: Passing the observability torch

After 6 years at Hipster Shop you have decided you've had enough with tight jeans, large hat styles, and aging hipster denial. You have just put in your two-weeks notice as lead DevOps engineer. You have accepted a new position at Gen-Z Fam Store that begins at the end of the month.

## Observability should not leave with you
When it comes to observability at Hipster Shop you have grown a reputation as the "New Relic guru" and you worry that other members of the team don't realize how invaluable the platform is to the company. You have been asked to spend your final two weeks setting up the team for success with New Relic after you leave. 

### Hipster Shop's current state 
At the moment, all of the custom dashboards, attributes, queries, alerts, synthetics, etc. within New Relic have been created and maintained by you. There are around 8 other engineers who access New Relic about once a week. These people can make simple queries and have helped you with specific tasks in the past but their understanding of the platform is limited.

### Your plan 
With your remaining two weeks dedicated to passing the proverbial observability torch you have decided you need to do the following:

1. Create as many resources you feel would be necessary in the Hipster Shop New Relic account to demonstrate the value gained using the platform. *This could come in the form of custom dashboards, alerts, etc. The goal here is to prove that New Relic saves Hipster Shop time and money. *
2. Identify the resources provided by New Relic that others need to be aware of in order to be successful moving forward. *Things to consider: Relevant New Relic docs, Introductions to New Relic staff, possible automation you can introduce to limit manual configuration, etc.  *
3. Create a presentation for a 1-hour meeting scheduled for you to lead on your final day. *This presentation will include executives and engineers. They are expecting to see a slideshow that includes everything they need to know moving forward as it relates how and why they should leverage New Relic after you leave.*
 
## Completing this workshop
After you have created your presentation, be sure to share the slidedeck with your facilitator(s). You will be expected to share your plan of action with others later in this training.
